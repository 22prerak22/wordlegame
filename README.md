# Onscreen Keyboard with Dynamic Key States

This project implements an onscreen virtual keyboard using React and `react-simple-keyboard`, where key states dynamically change based on input. The key states (`correct`, `present`, and `absent`) are visually represented with different colors and animated transitions.

## Features

- **React-Based Onscreen Keyboard**: An interactive onscreen keyboard built with `react-simple-keyboard`.
- **Dynamic Key States**: Key colors dynamically update based on the provided letter statuses (correct, present, absent).
- **Smooth Animations**: Key transitions are animated to give visual feedback when the state changes.
- **Framer Motion Integration**: Smooth appearance and transitions using `framer-motion`.
